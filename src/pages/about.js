    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div className={styles.about}>
      <p>
        Wes Lillig began building things at an young age. His deep-rooted passion for making things stems from his early days in the Boy Scouts, 
        from which he remembers his first project making a pinewood derby car as a Cub Scout, and then the myriad of volunteer service projects 
        he worked as an Eagle Scout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the footsteps of his father and grandfather, Wes began his professional career as a carpenter. While working in commercial and
        residential construction, he discovered his knack for working through complicated builds. After one project took him from sheet rock and 
        studs to lumber and custom molding profiles, Wes became hooked on finer work and decided to pursue formal training.

        In 2014, Wes moved from Kansas City to Boston to begin his studies of Cabinetry and Furniture at the North Bennet Street School where he 
        would begin refining his skills for making fine furniture. He would later receive the Ddora Foundation Grant for "excellence in preserving 
        American craftsmanship", graduating in the spring of 2016.

        Today, Wes continues to fulfill his passion for woodworking. He specializes in designing and building custom furniture full-time as a member 
        of the Charlestown Furniture Makers Co-op. He has completed projects ranging from custom restaurant tables and bars, kitchen cabinets and islands, 
        dining tables and coffee tables, chairs and stools, end tables and night stands, even jewelry boxes and cutting boards. He also teaches private lessons.
      </p>

        In his free time, Wes enjoys playing rugby, cooking, and tending to his bonsai.
